# Terminal App - Subscription Management

## Project Description

This project aims to help the user to create and manage their own subscription lists, the features include view current subscription list, create new subscription, update/delete existing subscriptions and calculate the cost based on their frequencies. This application only supports single user for now, but in the future hopefully it will be implemented more features so it can allow multiple users to create their own lists, and they can log in with their username and passwords.
